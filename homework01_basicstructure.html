<h3> About Me</h3>
<p>My name is Jessica Doan. I am an international student who came from Vietnam five years ago in 2016. I grew up in the beautiful Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, a city that never sleeps. As a graphic designer, what do I want to say about my art? Growing up, I've always loved to go to crowded places for people-watching. Sitting in the corner of a coffee shop and watching how people interact with each other always bring me inspiration. I believe there is beauty in unusual places, and if we look closely, we will find those small details, which people tend to overlook, have their unique charm. <br>
      <br>
      As someone who has experienced different phases of depression over the years, I've learned to treasure little things in daily life and how one positive thing can help uplift a whole state of mind. Through my artworks, I hope people will find joy and inspiration in the ordinary. By using a vibrant color palette and elaborate typeface and imagery, I want to express my gleeful emotions, those inner thoughts that I can't put into words and spread that buoyant spirit to my viewers. I wish my work could be a bridge that helps people connect with their inner selves and bring out the rapture hidden inside. </p>
